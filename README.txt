This editor is plugged with Jakarta-Oro Regular expression package. This provides the interface for the package. Jakarta-Oro's Perl, AWK and GLOB Expresions can be executed in this plugin. Many options such as "matching" , "containg", "Multi-Line", "Debug" etc. are avaiable

WORKING:
--------
	This plug-in opens a wizard for the editor file and creates a editor file with extension ".rx". But contents are not saved. then after creating a file, the editor opens and the user can do his job with it. Using the "compile&run" button, the user can check and verify the regular expression is matching with data.
